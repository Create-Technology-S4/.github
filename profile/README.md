# About Me

<br />

> ### Day #7679_

_I go by the "Noah" here. It's been just over 21 years that I have spawned into this world._

_I have been able to travel their world. I have lived in places they name "USA", "France" and "China", the latter of which I have spent over half of my time. Does that make me "chinese"?_

_I have become accustomed to their ways of thinking and doing things. In particular, their ways of working with technology._

_I am pursuing some academic studies in the field of software engineering; currently in my 4th semester. For this semester, they seem to put emphasis on the creativity aspect of using technology to achieve something._

_For the remainder of my time in this world, I truly hope to have some lasting, positive impact no matter how small._
