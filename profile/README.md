# About Me

<br />

> ### Day #7679_

_I go by the "Noah" here. It's been just over 21 years that I have spawned into this world._

_I have been able to travel their world. I have lived in places they name "USA", "France" and "China", the latter of which I have spent over half of my time. Does that make me "chinese"?_

_I have become accustomed to their ways of thinking and doing things. In particular, their ways of working with technology._

_I am pursuing some academic studies in the field of software engineering; currently in my 4th semester. For this semester, they seem to put emphasis on the creativity aspect of using technology to achieve something._

_For the remainder of my time in this world, I truly hope to have some lasting, positive impact no matter how small._

# Projects

### Individual Project

> Name:     **Intuitive Computer Interaction**

> Duration: **2 Weeks**

This project, although relatively small, was our first project. It acted as an introductory project where we had complete freedom to choose whatever we want to work on, so long as it was creative technology-related. 

#### Conceptualization

When I was first introduced to what it means to be a creative technologist, one thing struck me in particular: user interactivity. Essentially, how will viwers/users interact with your work. With this in mind, I started brainstorming some ideas of what I could potentially do for my project.

As a software student, my area of expertise in technology is definitively software. However, when I think about user interactivity, there is always some hardware element that is used to control something virtually. Luckly, we were given various arduino components to play around with. I had all the ingredients I needed to make something interactive.

There is a lot of different places I could combine software and hardware to make something interact. To me, the domain that makes the most sense for such an idea is a videogame. Due the time constraints, I did not want to make build a game from scratch as that was not the main focus of my project so I settled on using a game that already existed and choose the game _Minecraft_.

3D videogames typially use some peripherals that allows the player to control a character. Specifically, the mouse is used to control the direction of the character's viewport (camera) and the keyboard trigger motion and I thought why not replace one of the peripherals with one of the components given. For my idea, I decided to use the gyroscope to control the camera. Why not map the gyroscope's orientation vector to the directional vector of the camera?

#### Prototypings

To make my idea come to light, I had to break down my project into smaller steps since I have never worked on such an idea before. Throughout this project, I came up with 3 different prototype where, to my suprise, we can clearly depict an evolution.
